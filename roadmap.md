# Python Learning Roadmap

This roadmap is designed for experienced programmers looking to learn Python efficiently. The plan is broken down into **4 phases** with estimated time per phase, but you can adjust the pace to suit your schedule.

---

## **Phase 1: Python Fundamentals (Week 1)**

**Goal:** Get comfortable with Python's syntax, control flow, and basic data structures.

### ✅ Topics

- Python syntax & dynamic typing
- Variables, expressions
- `if`, `for`, `while`, and `with` loops
- Lists, Tuples, Sets, Dictionaries
- Functions (including *args and **kwargs)
- String manipulation
- Basic file I/O
- Exceptions (`try/except/finally`)

---

## **Phase 2: Writing Pythonic Code (Week 2)**

**Goal:** Learn how to write elegant, idiomatic, and efficient Python.

### ✅ Topics

- List/dict/set comprehensions
- `enumerate`, `zip`, unpacking
- Lambdas & higher-order functions
- `map`, `filter`, `reduce`
- `args` and `*kwargs` in practice
- Slicing techniques
- `pathlib`, `collections`, `itertools`, `functools`
- Basic debugging (`pdb`, f-strings, logging)

---

## **🔹 Phase 3: Object-Oriented and Modular Python (Week 3–4)**

**Goal:** Learn how to build maintainable, modular code.

### ✅ Topics

- Classes and inheritance
- Special methods (`__str__`, `__repr__`, `__len__`, etc.)
- Properties and decorators
- Modules and packages
- Virtual environments
- Unit testing with `unittest` or `pytest`
- Type hinting with `typing`

---

## ** Phase 4: Build Projects (Weeks 5–6+)**


### Mini Project Ideas 

- 🗂 File organizer (CLI): Move/sort files by type/date
- 📊 CSV to JSON converter with validation
- 📦 Web scraper using `requests` + `BeautifulSoup`
- 🧠 Flashcard quiz CLI app
- 📈 Data visualizer using `pandas` + `matplotlib`
- 🌐 Build a REST API with `Flask` or `FastAPI`

### 📘 Suggested Tools & Libraries

- CLI: `argparse`, `click`, `rich`
- Web: `Flask`, `FastAPI`, `requests`, `httpx`
- Data: `pandas`, `numpy`, `matplotlib`, `seaborn`
- Parsing: `json`, `re`, `csv`, `xml.etree.ElementTree`
