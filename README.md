# Learn Python

Welcome to my Python learning journey! This repository is dedicated to tracking my progress as I learn Python, as well as providing resources, exercises, and mini-projects for anyone else looking to learn Python along the way.

This approach uses exercise and project based learning as I already have programming experience so it goes straight into completing exercises and projects that cover the fundamentals of any programming language.

I will be continuously adding to and updating this repo as I go along my Python learning journey.

## üìö Learning Roadmap

My learning journey is broken down into phases, each focused on mastering a specific set of concepts. The phases include hands-on exercises, stretch goals, and mini-projects to solidify my understanding of Python.

- [Phase 1: Python Fundamentals](./phases/phase1-fundamentals/notes.md)
- [Phase 2: Intermediate Python]()
- [Phase 3: Advanced Python]()

Check out the detailed roadmap here: [roadmap.md](./roadmap.md)

## üìù Exercises

In this repository, I‚Äôve included a wide range of exercises that cover key Python topics. Each exercise is designed to be hands-on, so you can test your understanding as you go.

The exercises are grouped by topic and will help you tackle different aspects of Python programming:

- **Phase 1: Python Fundamentals** ([exercises.md](./phases/phase1-fundamentals/exercises.md))
- **Phase 2: Intermediate Python** ()
- **Phase 3: Advanced Python** ()

Each exercise comes with its corresponding solution in the `solutions` folder.

## üèóÔ∏è Projects

Throughout my journey, I will build mini-projects to apply what I've learned. Each project will be a small but functional application that I can use to deepen my understanding of Python.


Check out all projects here: [projects/](./projects/)

## üåê Resources

I‚Äôll also be curating a list of useful links that i find as I go along as well as putting together a python cheatsheet

- **Useful Links**: [useful-links.md](./resources/useful-links.md)
- **Python Cheatsheet**: [python-cheatsheet.md](./resources/python-cheatsheet.md)
